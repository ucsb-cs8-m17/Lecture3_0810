Don't call your files the same name as any module you are importing.

E.g. if you do `import turtle`, don't call your file `turtle.py`

If you do `import math`, don't call your file `math.py`

# parameters vs. arguments

parameters are the things in a function definition such as the x
in this one:

```
def f(x):
  return x * x
```

arguments are things in function calls like the 3 in this function call

```
f(3)
```
